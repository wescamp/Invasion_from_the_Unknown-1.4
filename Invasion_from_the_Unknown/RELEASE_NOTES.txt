Alright. Not much time has passed, but [b]release 1.0.2 is out[/b].

It implicitly supersedes 1.0.1, the last release published through the campaign server; it also supersedes 1.0.0, the last release that was published in my website's UMC tree.

There are very few changes, but one of them is essential enough to invalidate your saved games. Analia has been renamed to AnlindÃ«, as per ESR's suggestion. I also restored some animation frames which Espreon considers vaguely different to the baseframes (I cannot understand his reasoning, though).

There are also greater changes that were introduced with the legendary 1.0.1:

* This campaign works on SVN branch 1.4; therefore you need release 1.4.0 or later to play it (no need for SVN if you don't know what it is).
* [b]Many[/b] issues related to macro parameter orders have been fixed. They were introduced during the period between 1.3.19 and 1.4.0, in mainline; I consider this pure evilness, but it was beyond my control at that time.
* [b]Musicpack is no longer required:[/b] most of the music included in it was added to mainline before releasing 1.4.0; therefore you just need to make sure you have Wesnoth's music tracks installed (which should be the default unless you use Debian GNU/Linux, according to the rumors).
* Some cosmetic modifications were made to scenarios and portraits. They include, but aren't limited to, changing the background music according to the plot context; I did it based on West's suggestion on #wesnoth-dev.
* "Dealing with Orcs" is being refactored; however, it is still hidden.
* Walking Corpses are spawned in the same hex a player's unit died at; this requires Wesnoth 1.4.0 or later. Period. You cannot use Wesnoth 1.3.19 or earlier; attempting to do so may cause a crash.

Therefore, you just need to download the campaign.

* At the Wesnoth campaign server, for 1.4.x. Bandwidth seems to have been dramatically increased, thus you shouldn't worry much about it.
* Additionally, you can download the campaign at [url=http://shadowm.nfshost.com/wesnoth-UMC/Invasion_from_the_Unknown/Invasion_from_the_Unknown-1.0.2.tar.bz2]my website[/url]; please note that I'm not providing installation instructions for it, and you should consult Wesnoth's wiki instead.

Downloading from the campaign server is worth 11.6 MB aproximately; if you can't afford that much you might want to download and install it manually from my website; since that package is transferred in its compressed form you can save pretty more than half its size via that medium.

I'd like to thank the following people for their help:

* Mythological, for bug-fixing published releases during my absence, even though I didn't ask/force him to do so.
* ESR, for his prose-doctoring work (although at the moment of this release it included just 3 scenarios).
* Kitty, for providing me a high-res portrait that now serves as Elynia's placeholder.
* An anonymous user who sent me a gettext patch to my e-mail address. Well, it wasn't anonymous, I just don't recall his or her name at this moment.
* Hamish A., for web hosting.

For translators: this campaign's .po and .pot files have not been updated properly in WesCamp yet; I'm aware of the problem and I shall fix it soon.

Now, go to play and enjoy!
