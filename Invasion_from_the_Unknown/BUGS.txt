Known bugs:
-----------

* Scenario "Dawn of the Great War" causes the game to look like frozen after the initial
  dialogue, just before the player regains control and the new objectives get displayed;
  this is known to happen at least on openSUSE 10.3 x86_64 kernel 2.6.22.5-31-default
  with Wesnoth 1.4+SVN, without optimizations. Possibly does not affect official binaries
  or anything else that was compiled with optimizations.
  The game seems to freeze for about 10 seconds.

* Some units may not display properly if haloes are disabled in the game preferences;
  this is due to the way they are extended over more space than it could fit one hex,
  as a workaround to an engine limitation. I hope we can work it out in Wesnoth 1.5.x.
  Affected units include: Faerie Spirit, Kagthanus Matrix Core, Kagthanus Matrix Flowsystem.

* Damage floating labels ocassionally don't display over units of the Elvish Warrior Spirit
  line when they result harmed during a fight. The cause is not known yet.

* Story line is inconsistent, specially after "Bye and Behold" and before "Arrival of
  the Battalion" (not really continuous). This is known and is caused by some scenarios
  that are not yet enabled, but which should take place in-between.

* Some Chaos faction units seem to "pop out" during fight; this is caused by a mixture of
  both deprecated animation frames and a modern standing frame. Id est, those deprecated
  animation frames must be updated.

Note that here are listed only those bugs that are known by the author, and that have not been
fixed in this release; usually there are still more bugs to be found, and most of them are fixed
before a new release is made, thus don't get to be listed in this file.

If you happen to find a new bug, please report it as soon as possible at www.wesnoth.org/forum/,
Scenario & Campaign dev. subforum, thread "Invasion from the Unknown", with as much information
as possible to help us find the cause and fix the bug.


Please do not e-mail me for anything related to the campaign; I usually get my inbox filled with
messages and cannot examine one by one. Therefore, forum personal messaging is preferred, but
*ONLY* if you really need to talk with me directly. You should PM "Shadow Master" in such a case.
