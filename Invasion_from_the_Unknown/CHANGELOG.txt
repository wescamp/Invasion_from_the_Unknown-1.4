Invasion from the Unknown Changelog
------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.0:

    * Made it easier to update version numbers in the future, though it makes the presence
      of file tags/VERSION.tag mandatory
    * Ran wmllint; the units/ directory is still begging for manual fixes. However, the
      WML of the campaign overall should be now clean enough to allow for easy migration
      to SVN trunk with wmllint
    * Refactored item pick-up mechanism, making it easier to maintain, and easier
      to use from the player's side; it is also guaranteed that all of them can be

    * NPC movement algorithms:

            o lady-of-light-attack3.png
    * Removed graphics:

- Language, i18n and l10n:
    * Did some textdomain layout optimization on /utils/items.cfg and /utils/glamour.cfg; in particular,
      set wesnoth-lib textdomain for strings "Cancel", "Yes" and "No", instead of our own, so that they
      are translated as standard GUI elements and not as part of this campaign
    * Made all UtBS schedules on /utils/schedules.cfg be under this campaign's textdomain effect
    * Updated translations:
        + French (Zoltic):
          (nil)
        + Italian (Brivido):
          (nil)
        + Spanish (Shadow Master):
          1956 translated messages, 0 fuzzy translations, 620 messages not translated yet
- Scenarios:
    * Implemented workaround on Analia's spawning code and Elynia's (scenario #10, and E4 boss)
      that enforces gender= on them to be the correct one. Wesnoth 1.3.14+svn r23135 seems not to use unique gender=
      statements in UnitsWML and copy them onto spawned single units unless explicitly asked. The result is pretty awkward
      now that unit's race can be translated even for singular forms, and display on the unit stats panel ;)
    * Reestructuration:
        + Removed scenarios:
            o (19) Infested Pass
            o (21) E3 Boss (moved to 19)
            o (23) Lands of Chaos
    * Scenario 3:
        + Fixed typo in a dialogue line
    * Scenario 10:
        + Elynia's name is translatable as it should have always been (i18n bug)
    * Scenario 18 "The Dawn (...)":
        + Fixed all legacy bugs:
            o duplicated enemy leader identifiers
        + Remade map and WML, embedding the plot of old scenario 19 inside
    * Scenario 19:
        + Replaced with scenario 21, made E3 Boss scenario
    * Scenario 21:
        + Elynia's hero icon is removed temporarily, to avoid overlapping the canrecruit=1 crown
        + Now Elynia glows in a golden tone when she touches the special glyph
        + Revised map
        + Revised scenario's gameplay
    * Scenario 21 - 22 Interlude:
        + Fixed a map flaw which could cause a hero to be recalled on a water tile
    * Scenario 23A (Innuendo):
        + Fixed a bug which caused the dungeon prisoners to be spawned whenever an unit moved
          onto their locations
    * Scenario 23B (Gauntlet):
        + Elyssa can't attack a second time when respawned during her own turn
    * Scenario 24B:
        + Fixed a bug which caused enemy waves to be spawned for the rest of eternity
        + Modified Death Knight summoning logic
- Shadow Master's standard macro infrastructure:
    * Internal macros:
        + Render WML:
            o __RC_PALETTE should declare new palletes properly now
- Terrain WML:
    * Fixes to double terrain aliasing:
        + Made campfire terrains be aliases of a root terrain, "Xu"
          (they were aliases of "Mm^Xm formerly)
        + Made phantom castle "Uu^Cd" be alias of a root terrain, "Ch" (was "Cud" formerly)
        + Made phantom keep "Uu^Kd" be alias of a root terrain, "Ch" (was "Kud" formerly)
        + Made road "Ryd" be alias of a root terrain, "Gg" (was "Rr" formerly)
    * Rearranged some transitions order to produce a consistent appearance
    * Removed Gg^Vwm (Windmill/Village) as per conversation with zookeeper
    * Renamed campfire's string "^Fi" to "^Fy" to revent future conflicts with mainline
- Units:
    * Abilities:
        + Glamour option is not offered on known "chasm" or "cavewall" terrains to
          avoid "getting stuck" at the unit's location after changing to a status that
          has no movement on those tiles
    * Balancing:
        + Increased required XP for advancement of Blood Bat to Dread Bat from 42 to 60
        + Increased Tiger's resistance to arcane damage from 0% to 10%
        + Decreased Cockatrice's resistance to arcane damage from 20% to -50%
        + Decreased Chimera's resistance to arcane damage from 20% to -50%
        + Decreased Shaxthal Drone's HP from 35 to 28
        + Decreased Assault Drone's HP from 47 to 42
        + Decreased Sentry Drone's HP from 51 to 46
        + Removed Marksman special from Fire Spirit's ranged attack
        + Decreased Fire Wisp's ranged damage from 6-2 to 4-2
        + Changed Fire Spirit's ranged damage from 8-2 to 6-3
        + Kagthanus Flow System Tube and Kagthanus Matrix Core can no longer receive random traits
    * Gave Sleeping Gryphon the missing "awake" animations ;)
    * Mainline conformance:
        + Death Baron:
            o Added a 5-2 ranged attack (pierce)
            o Increased hitpoints from 54 to 55
            o Increased required leveling experience from 90 to 100
            o Reduced number of melee strikes by one
            o Renamed melee attack from "sword" to "axe" (suggested by Jetryl and Eternal)
            o Updated special notes conventions
    * New or refactored units:
        + Kagthanus Matrix Core (fixed all animation glitches except on-select by using a more
          complex set of masked halo and baseframes; HP and XP bars should always display properly now
        + Kagthanus Matrix Flow System
    * Optimized filtering on variable-cost elvish units, therefore fixing a bug that caused them
      to be excluded from certain Standard Unit Filter, specially those used for special objects
    * Shaxthal datafiles have had their "alien" prefix removed for continuity
    * Removed units:
        + Shaxthal Drone
    * Renamed units:
        + Blood Knight -> Hell Knight
