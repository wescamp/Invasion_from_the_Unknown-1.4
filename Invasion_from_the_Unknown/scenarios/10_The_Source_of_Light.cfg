        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Now I am afraid too that the time to tell the story of the demon lord Yanqui has come. Anlindë might have told you little, vague references to it, but you need to know what you are facing. It is not as simple as it seems.")}

        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "It is time. Now, you probably want to sit down on the grass. This will take quite a long time to tell.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "We should start with the old story of the Golden Age. The continent was dominated by Humans on the central lands, known as their Empire of Wesnoth back then. The Elves lived on the North-eastern, North-western and South-western forests, although small groups also wandered around Wesnoth. The Dwarves controlled all the mountains, hills and suchlike, usually competing with the fierce orcs and trolls who also liked that kind of terrains.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "The forests south of the Dwarven Kingdom of Knalga were known as the Wesmere forest. Peaceful lands north-west from the Empire of Wesnoth. The elves that lived there considered knowledge the most valuable thing in this world, so they were enthusiastic in investigating every secret of the world where we live. Every and each one, including the darkest ones...")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Nobody knows exactly how it happened, but they awoke some greater evil with their experiments, opening a portal to the underworld, just out of their curiosity and ambition of wisdom. That is when Yanqui appeared, in the form of a young elf. He told them that a great darkness was going to swallow the lands and destroy all the knowledge they had collected over the years, and said that he would protect them if they worshiped him as a god, giving them unlimited knowledge and power, just what they wanted. Ambition blinded their minds, and agreed, even though Yanqui demanded blood sacrifices as part of the deal. All those who disagreed ended their lives as the first sacrifices for the demon lord.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "But something else was happening in non-elven lands. The humans of Wesnoth, or more specifically, the King of Wesnoth, had created a second sun some time before all this, Naia, which you can see now every day, by gathering all capable magi and sending a mountain to the skies, to shine as a sun, only to destroy darkness and evilness forever. It was initially a success, although the darkness was not abolished completely. But the human's greed led them to send a third mountain to the skies, by the time Yanqui appeared. He must have had predicted that, and the Wesmere elves knew of what would happen, so he used the fact to trick them.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "The third sun, Gaia, was to be sent to the skies. But the magi had not worried about learning magic as much as they had before the creation of Naia, since the evilness that forced them to learn magic millenia ago, was seemingly gone. The king of Wesnoth decreed the creation of Gaia, nevertheless, not following my advice. Yes, I was there, and to my heart's pain, I witnessed all that happened that fateful day.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "It's ironical how we elves always despised humans because of their moral, intellectual and biological inferiority. The humans caused our doom, but a part of us made it worse.")}
        {MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "But, what happened with the third sun?")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "As I said, the human magi's mastery of magic arts was not as strong as it used to be, and their attempt to lift and send Gaia to the skies was a total disaster. Their powers were not capable of setting Gaia to remain high in the skies, and the mountain fell off, crashing down onto Weldyn, the kingdom's capital, causing volcanoes to erupt all over the planet, starting a mass earth-quake that destroyed cities, valleys, even mountains. All that was beautiful and worth was then ruined.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "The humans struggled to survive, but they killed the king, the magi, and their families for the chaos they had caused. A chaos that caused horrible wars amongst Elves, Dwarves, Orcs and Trolls, altogether. Naia and Sela, the remaining monuments to the human's empire, their greed, arrogancy and hubris, scorched all known lands, drying up rivers, fields, forests and lakes. But with the power given by Yanqui, Wesmere Forest stood intact, still peaceful and green. However, Yanqui declared all foreign elves heretics that did not deserve to live.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "So, as elves from other forests came to Wesmere as refugees, the dark cultists sacrificed them to Yanqui. The pain and agony was feeding him, growing his power stronger and greater, but when no more refugees came there, he ordered to organize raidings for capturing elves, humans, orcs, or whatever they could find in the outside lands. With the solar activity increasing, our forests were burned or dried out, and we had to abandon them. I had led my people out of the Northern forests, and we stumbled upon the Wesmere Forest.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Obviously, not knowing what was happening in there, we decided to ask for refuge in Wesmere. However, at night during our travel to the capital, we were attacked. Many of us died, specially elders and children, who were sacrificed to Yanqui, as my husband, the Lord of Darkness, Argan, could find out, risking his own life. So we found ourselves in a difficult choice - stop our brethren, the Wesmere elves, and free them from the great evil, or go away and let more of our people, eventually us, be sacrificed by the cultists. Painfully, I chose the first, and started the War of Wesmere.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Even though our number was superior, their religious frenzy, obsession and fear of destruction, almost led the Wesmere elves to victory. We fought with all our might, but that only called upon the fury of the demon lord, who appeared in his true form, to attack us from the skies. I and Argan had to call upon the power of the Union, risking destruction by our own powers, in order to defeat Yanqui. The Union of the Darkness and Light was not powerful enough, however, to destroy the demon, at least not entirely - its regeneration power was stronger.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Finally we managed to tear apart his body, and seal all parts, and send them back to the underworld, destroying immediately the portal that was opened from Wesmere to the underworld.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "The victory had its price, however. The battlefield, Wesmere, was a wreck, and no life was left there, except for a few survivors, less than one hundred elves. The Wesmere elves surrended and begged for forgiveness, and told us the whole story. We let them live, except for the priests, which we had to execute and burn, until reducing their bodies to nothing but dust. We could not risk the possibility of them opening a portal again and summoning Yanqui a second time. Nor the possibility of future generations starting the same war once again, which would extermine us definitively in the new harsh world. So we also had to forbid telling the story, executing anyone who would dare to tell it.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "However, we were never sure whether we killed every cultist or not. One of them could escape execution, acting as innocent, as a simple ignorant follower, not cultist. I felt she had to be executed, but unfortunately the rest of my people did not agree. And you have her just by your side, Galas.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "Anlindë? But... but, she...")}
        {MSG_UNIT Anlindë ( _ "I was a priestess to Yanqui, but not willing. I was forced by him, he would have killed my family otherwise. I regreted my decission when I saw him killing them from the skies, as I realized that worshiping him could not save my family from a horrible death.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "But then, why the elves parted ways?")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Anlindë wanted them to return East. She said that we should have explored the unknown instead of retreating south. That, and Alduil's foolishness, made us all depart different ways. I and Argan decided that our people no longer needed us, for Alduil and Anlindë would not listen to us, and Tanuil with his small group went South, where I felt no longer capable of going to, after the fight against Yanqui, which weakened us. So I and Argan went here, to the depths, to live in peace. I am still surprised that Alduil and Anlindë could find a valley with life in the far East, perhaps I was wrong after all.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "However, one day, Argan disappeared. I could not feel his presence any longer, and I waited for years, and years, until I fell asleep, fell after the powers of Darkness which were evil for me without the Union with Argan. Meanwhile, most of my powers have diminished, because of lack of practice and use. I am not sure I can help you in this fight at all.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "But I will try anyway. I can't avoid, though, to be disturbed by the fact that one has opened a portal and possibly summoned back Yanqui. The person who did that, must have known this history in some way, or have done it by accident.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Althurin ( _ "Or be related in some way to Yechnagoth. She somehow also knew of Yanqui, or that was what we had been told by our hero, Rogrimir.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Yechnagoth... the Eater of Souls?")}
        {MSG_UNIT Althurin ( _ "Yes. According to the history, the Quenoth desert elves, led by Kalehssar, son of Tanuil, defeated her in an isle far to the west, in middle of the unknown ocean. She could corrupt all souls from that place, including humans, orcs, nagas and saurians. After being defeated, though, that influence was gone. But some humans still had a leader, and they are the ones behind all this plot, I think. The 'loyalists'. They just want to expand their empire by taking over these lands and other to be discovered yet.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "Interesting, but how could a simple human control these forces? There must be something else, more powerful, behind this.")}
        {MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "I think we should move and quit wasting time here. The world needs us. And we have got to find Argan.")}
        {MSG_UNIT Elynia ( _ "I do not think we shall find him. It is like... like if the earth itself swallowed him.")}
