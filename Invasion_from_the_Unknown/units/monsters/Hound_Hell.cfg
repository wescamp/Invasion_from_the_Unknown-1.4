They turn into their leaders by the dread they inspire into other followers of Chaos, and the intelligence they have developed as heartless half-demons. Because it is not common for these hounds to acquire enoguh experience to evolve this further, as their frantic attacks usually harms them to death. Thus, at this point they are respected and treated as heroes by their comrades."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BERSERK}
