This is not the README file. See README.txt for that.

Just want to say that the tagfiles (*.tag) are used by the maintenance scripts, and should not be removed from the campaign server, to ease automatization of the manual WesCamp system by maintainers. If the campaign server is upgraded to allow automatic WesCamp transactions, then the "*.tag" entry should be added to the _server.ign file, but the actual files SHOULD NOT be removed in any case.
