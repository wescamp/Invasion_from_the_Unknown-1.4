				INVASION FROM THE UNKNOWN / ARMAGEDDON SPOILERS

Author: Shadow Master (Ignacio Riquelme Morelle)

This is the Spoilers file for version 0.10.0. This file is a.k.a. "Changelog in a nutshell",
for people who suffer bad headaches when reading the messy changelogs I write. ;)

The main focus of it are the easter-eggs and oddities that I hid throughout this campaign's
scenarios. There are historical notes on development of scenarios too.

EPISODE 1: INTO THE DARKNESS
============================

Scenario 2: A Real Confrontation
--------------------------------
This scenario was a polemic one since the beginning of this campaign, and probably
caused it to sink into forgottendom at that time, until Aethaeryn, on #wesnoth IRC told
me his opinions on it, which was the first scenario at that time. I remade it and moved
it to be scenario 2, but it didn't happen until version 0.9.2, that I noticed that most
of the players that like this campaign's plot would like to see this scenario replaced
with something sane. I tried balancing the map and objectives, but I decided that the
scenario's plot overall was shit, and rewrote it, keeping just some dialogues. The result
is something that pleases me, a beautiful map and a beautiful battle, which becomes
interesting due to the mountains and clear grasslands near the enemies.


Scenario 3: Horrors from the Depths
-----------------------------------
- At 2,46 there's a hidden sign-post. The only way to reach it is to move a faerie
  along the subterranean river.
- At 24,39 there's a hidden village. The only way to reach it is to cheat, creating
  a bat or other proper flying unit, and moving it to that location across the surrounding
  chasm. The result is a nice easter-egg that makes you lose the scenario. Partly a joke
  at the www.wesnoth.org forum people, and partly a trap for cheaters.

Scenario 4: Over the Sands
--------------------------
- If you send an unit to the gryphon's nest at 11,32, you'll open a secret passage that
  leads to a secret level, "Cursed Plateau", skipping "Crossfire".

Scenario 5A: Crossfire
----------------------
- If you spare the fugitive's life, you'll see him again on scenario 23, but in a different
  form.

Scenario 6: Moon Valley
-----------------------
- A Yeti hides in the mountains at valley's SW border

Scenario 7: E1 Boss
-------------------
- If you kill the boss while Galas is in the opposite side of the chamber (i.e. looking at the
  eastern walls, he'll discover a secret tunnel that leads to the Secret City, a scenario 8
  replacement that, anyway, converges into the same dwarves-vs-trolls-and-loyalists battle.

Scenario 8A: Errand of Hope
---------------------------
- You can convince Eela and her companions to join your cause by offering them "fun".

Scenario 9: The Library
-----------------------
- If you step on the hex at 20,2, you'll unlock a secret area of this level, that contains
  the complete prophecy of the Union, guarded, though, by many shaxthal foes. However, they
  will attack your other enemies too. The touchplate and everything will be enabled at the start
  if you went through scenario 8B (Secret City) and found the same secret area.

Scenario 10: The Source of Light
--------------------------------
- The scenario's design is a partial replica of a scenario on my never-published-nor-finished
  campaign for Wesnoth 1.0.2. The only difference is that in that version you had to find a way
  to open the chamber of the Ruby of Fire, not Elynia.

Scenario 11: Strike on New Knalga
---------------------------------
- The scenario was originally designed to be smaller and worse for claustrophobic people.

Scenario 12: The Escape
-----------------------
- The scenario was originally designed to be on the surface, not underground

Scenario 13: E2 Boss
--------------------
- The scenario was originally designed to be on the surface, not underground
